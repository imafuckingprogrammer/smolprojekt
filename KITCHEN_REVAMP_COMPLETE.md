## 🚀 **New Simplified Architecture**

### **1. Separated Kitchen Sessions from Auth**
- **Before:** Kitchen sessions conflicted with user authentication
- **After:** Independent kitchen session system (`useKitchenSession`)
- **Result:** Multiple people can be in kitchen without conflicts

### **2. Clear Order Status Workflow**
```
PENDING → [Start Preparing] → PREPARING → [Mark Ready] → READY → [Mark Served] → SERVED
```

**Action Buttons:**
- **Pending Orders:** "Start Preparing" (claims + sets to preparing)
- **Preparing Orders:** "Mark Ready" or "Release"
- **Ready Orders:** "Mark Served"

### **3. Persistent Sessions**
- Sessions stored in localStorage
- Automatic restoration on page refresh
- 30-second heartbeat to keep alive
- Clean session cleanup on leave

### **4. Better Real-time**
- Simplified subscription management
- No more channel conflicts
- Instant updates across all kitchen staff

- Table number
- Order age (with red highlighting for old orders)

- **Yellow Border:** Pending orders
